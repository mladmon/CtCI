## Solutions to problems from CtCI in Python
*Still a work in progress.*

This repository contains my solutions to problems from Cracking the Coding Interview (CtCI), implemented in Python. The directories are named such that they correspond to chapters from the book. Within each directory, the scripts that begin with a number correspond to specific problems in that chapter. For example, [4.4-check_balanced.py](https://github.com/mladmon/CtCI/blob/master/04-trees_graphs/4.4-check_balanced.py) refers to problem *4.4 Check Balanced* from *Ch. 4 Trees and Graphs*. Scripts that do not begin with numbers contain data structures and other facilities that multiple solutions rely on (and hence ```import```).

At the bottom of each solution, you'll find a ```# Let's test it!``` section that serves to test the solution for correctness and also make it more interactive. To run the code, simply run:

```python3 4.4-check_balanced.py```

Cheers, and good luck with the interview prep! You'll do great :)
